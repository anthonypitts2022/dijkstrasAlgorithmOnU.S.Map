# dijkstrasAlgorithmOnU.S.Map
This is a program that displays a map of U.S. cities and can solve the shortest path from on city to another using Dijkstra's algorithm.

I am responsible for Dijkstra's algorithm as implemented in the Dijkstra.java file. The rest of the program is thanks to Paul S. Blaer.
